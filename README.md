# 🚘 License Plate Detection using YOLOv11n

This project demonstrates a real-time car license plate detection system using **YOLOv11n**, a lightweight and ultra-fast object detection model optimized for resource-constrained environments.

## 🧠 Model Used

- **YOLOv11n** (Nano version of YOLOv11)
- Ideal for real-time inference on edge devices
- Trained and fine-tuned specifically for license plate detection tasks

## 📸 Project Description

Using YOLOv11n, the system detects and localizes car license plates in images or video streams. This model is perfect for smart surveillance, toll booths, and automated parking systems where lightweight and quick responses are necessary.

### 🔍 Features
